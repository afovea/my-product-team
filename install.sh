product-team-skills — filesystem install

Most people want the plugin instead. In Claude Code:

    /plugin marketplace add afovea/my-product-team
    /plugin install product-team

That gives you all 31 skills plus the gate-enforcement hook, updatable with one
command. Use this script when you also want the routing brain, or when plugins
are unavailable (WSL, offline, a non-Claude-Code host).

Usage:

    ./install.sh /path/to/project     Skills + routing brain into that project
    ./install.sh .                    The same, into the current directory
    ./install.sh --personal           Skills into ~/.claude/skills (every project)
    ./install.sh --routing-only PATH  Routing brain only — for when you already
                                      installed the plugin and just want Claude
                                      to pick the right role for you
    ./install.sh --submodule PATH     Per-project, pinned to a tag, symlinked
    ./install.sh --verify             Report what is installed where
    ./install.sh --help               This message

Add --agents to any of the above to write the open-standard layout instead:
skills into .agents/skills/ and the routing brain into AGENTS.md, which is what
Codex and other SKILL.md hosts read. Invocation there is $name, not /name.

    ./install.sh --agents --personal        Skills into ~/.agents/skills
    ./install.sh --agents /path/to/project  Skills + routing brain, Codex layout

No target is assumed. Pass a path, or '.' for the current directory.
