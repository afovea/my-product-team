"""Stop hook: refuse to end the turn while a pipeline run has failing gates.

Wired from hooks/hooks.json. Reads the Stop event JSON on stdin and answers
on stdout. Exit 0 always, because Claude Code only parses decision JSON on
exit 0.

Behaviour:
  no open run          -> silent pass, no gates run
  valid stamp          -> silent pass, no gates run
  gates pass           -> stamp written, silent pass
  gates fail           -> {"decision": "block"} with the failing output
  repeated failures    -> stops blocking after MAX_BLOCKS, warns the user

The run-open sentinel is the pipeline's state file. A run is open while the
file exists, does not carry "gate_required": false, and, where it records a
run status (run-pipeline's `pipeline.json`), that status is not finished.
