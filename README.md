# product-team-skills

A coordinated product team as **29 Agent Skills** — 20 role perspectives, an 8-skill delivery pipeline, and a Project Point of Truth practice — with a routing brain that decides which one a request belongs to.

Invoke a role when you want a specific discipline's judgement: a PRD, a component spec, an accessibility review, a threat model, a motion spec, an animated explainer, a release decision. Run the pipeline when a coding task should be classified, chunked and verified rather than just done.

Every role is project-agnostic, so the same suite works on any codebase without dragging another project's context along.

See the kinds of end-to-end product work these skills can undertake individually and in combination.

**→ [Capability map](./docs/capability-map.md)**  
Where each capability sits in the triple-diamond product cycle, what the eleven repeated ones do differently at each phase, and what each phase writes to the Project Point of Truth.

**→ [Project Point of Truth](#project-point-of-truth)**  
The human-governed register of a product's durable facts, decisions, constraints and assumptions — read by every skill before it works, and proposed back to afterwards.

**→ [The Figma board](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1668354152302142589/afoveas-product-delivery-team-skills)**  
The same model as a FigJam workshop kit: a run-sheet per capability, timed zones, and the gates that close each diamond.

## Quick start

**Find your row, then read that section.** Which Claude you are in decides the
method — they are not interchangeable, and using the wrong one is the single
most common failed install.

---

### A · Claude web (`claude.ai` in a browser)

Chat, in a browser. Download the roles you want and upload them.

1. **Settings → Capabilities** → switch on **Code execution** and **File
   creation**. Skills do not run without both.
2. Download a role — say
   [product-designer.zip](https://github.com/afovea/product-team-skills/raw/main/download/product-designer.zip)
   or [product-manager.zip](https://github.com/afovea/product-team-skills/raw/main/download/product-manager.zip).
   All 29 are in [`download/`](./download). **Do not unzip them.**
3. **Settings → Capabilities → Skills → +** → upload the file → switch it on.
4. Ask for what you want, naming the role: *"As a product designer, our reports
   page is blank for new users. Design the empty state."*

Uploads attach to your account, so they appear in the app's Chat tab too — do
this once, not twice.

### B · Claude app, Chat tab

Same product as A, same files, **different menu**. The app has a
**Customize** entry that the browser does not.

1. **Settings → Capabilities** → switch on **Code execution** and **File
   creation**.
2. Download the roles you want from [`download/`](./download).
3. **Customize** in the left sidebar → **Skills** → **+** → upload → switch it on.
4. Ask for what you want, naming the role.

Already done it in the browser? Your skills are already here. Skip this.

### C · Claude app, Code tab (Claude Code)

Not chat — this is Claude Code inside the app. Installs all 29 at once, with no
terminal: the two lines go into the ordinary message box.

```
/plugin marketplace add afovea/product-team-skills
/plugin install product-team
```

If it says `Run /reload-plugins to activate.`, run that too. Then type
`/product-` — the roles should autocomplete:

```
/product-manager Turn this vague feature request into a delivery-ready ticket.
```

The app asks for a project folder before you can send anything. Pick any folder —
the install goes onto your account, works in every folder afterwards, and writes
nothing into the one you picked.

### D · Claude Code in a terminal

Identical to C. Run `claude` from any folder, then type the same two lines.

```
/plugin marketplace add afovea/product-team-skills
/plugin install product-team
```

### For C and D

You also get the delivery pipeline and the gate-enforcement hook. Add
[the routing brain](#the-routing-brain-optional-second-layer) with
`./install.sh --routing-only /path/to/project` and Claude picks the role for you.

> Copy those two lines exactly. The names differ by a hyphen — the repo is
> `product-team-skills`, the marketplace `productteam-skills`, the plugin
> `product-team`. `/plugin install product-team@product-team-skills` fails with
> `Plugin "product-team" not found in marketplace "product-team-skills"`.

### E · Claude Code on the web (cloud sessions)

Cloud sessions do not read your machine, and the plugin browser is unavailable
there. Declare the plugin in the repository instead, and everyone who opens a
cloud session on it gets the skills automatically.

Add this to `.claude/settings.json` **in that repository** and commit it:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "productteam-skills": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "afovea/product-team-skills" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": { "product-team@productteam-skills": true }
}
```

Merge these keys into the file if it already exists. If `.gitignore` contains
`.claude/`, add `!.claude/settings.json` or the file will never be committed.

### F · Codex, and other `SKILL.md` hosts

Not Claude at all. The skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)
standard, so any host built on it reads them — Codex included. Two differences:
they live in `.agents/skills/`, and you invoke one with `$name`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/afovea/product-team-skills.git
cd product-team-skills
./install.sh --agents --personal
```

All 29 into `~/.agents/skills/`, available in every project. Restart Codex, then:

```
$product-manager Turn this vague feature request into a delivery-ready ticket.
```

Add `--agents` to any other mode for the same result in that layout —
`./install.sh --agents /path/to/project` also writes the routing brain to the
project's `AGENTS.md` and seeds the pipeline adapter. Gate enforcement travels
too: the `Stop` hook works on both hosts.

## Invoking a skill

**Whichever route you installed by, give the role the actual task in the same
message.** Summoning a role with nothing to do gets you a question back, not the
work.

### In a browser or the app's chat

Name the role in ordinary words. Claude picks the skill from what you wrote.

```
As a product designer, our reports page is blank for new users. Design the empty state.
Acting as an accessibility specialist, this chart uses colour alone for four series. Problem?
As a content designer, rewrite this error: "Error 4012: request failed."
```

If Claude picks the wrong expert, say so — "answer this as a content designer,
not a product manager". Uploading fewer skills makes it pick better.

### In Codex

Type `$` then the skill name. Everything else is the same.

```
$product-designer Our reports page is blank for new users. Design the empty state.
$security-specialist Review this migration for RLS gaps.
$run-pipeline Add a /health route returning DB connectivity.
```

### In Claude Code

Type `/` then the skill name.

```
/product-designer Our reports page is blank for new users. Design the empty state.
/security-specialist Review this migration for RLS gaps.
/accessibility-specialist This chart uses colour alone for four series. Problem?
/run-pipeline Add a /health route returning DB connectivity.
```

Two forms both work:

| Form | Use when |
|---|---|
| `/product-designer` | Normal use — shortest form |
| `/product-team:product-designer` | Unambiguous. Needed only if a personal or project skill shares the name |

### Automatic selection differs by host, on purpose

In Claude Code every role and pipeline skill sets `disable-model-invocation: true`, so describing a
design problem in prose will **not** auto-summon `/product-designer`. That is
deliberate: automatic invocation selects by description keyword-matching, and
testing showed that picks badly — "payments integration" pulled the Pricing
Strategist, "release risk" pulled the Delivery Manager. You get selection
explicitly with `/name`, or via [the routing brain](#the-routing-brain-optional-second-layer)
when you don't know which discipline you want.

Codex is told the same thing in its own dialect. It does not read
`disable-model-invocation`, so each of those 28 skills carries an
`agents/openai.yaml` setting `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false`. Without
that file the roles would fire on their own there — the exact behaviour measured
and rejected above. CI checks the two stay in step, so a new skill cannot suppress
itself on one host and not the other.

The `/ppot` practice is the exception. Its natural-language phrases — such as
“bring me up to speed”, “record our decision”, and “check this against the
project truth” — are its intended interface, so it may be selected automatically.

The Claude apps have no `/name` invocation at all, so Claude choosing is the only
mechanism there. The ZIPs under [`download/`](./download) therefore ship with
that line stripped — keeping it would package skills that could never fire.
Naming the role in your sentence is how you steer the choice.

### Once invoked, a skill stays loaded

The persona persists across turns for the rest of the conversation. Invoke a different one to switch; start a fresh session to drop it.

[↑ Back to contents](#contents)

## Project Point of Truth

The suite includes a `/ppot` practice for consulting and maintaining a product’s
`PPoT.md` — a concise, human-governed register of durable facts, decisions,
constraints, assumptions, and learning.

Every other product-team skill is compatible with it. When relevant, a skill:

1. **pulls** established context from `PPoT.md` before working;
2. preserves the difference between confirmed knowledge and uncertainty;
3. **pushes** durable new knowledge back as a proposal after the work;
4. waits for explicit approval before the PPoT is changed.

The practice is available directly:

```text
/ppot brief
/ppot ask What do we know about enterprise onboarding?
/ppot decide We will release read-only sharing first
/ppot check docs/new-feature-prd.md
/ppot review
```

Natural language works too: “Bring me up to speed”, “Remember that users treat
archive as reversible”, or “Check this PRD against the project truth”. The PPoT
belongs in the consuming product repository; this plugin supplies the practice
and starter template, not the project’s facts.

**→ [How to use the Project Point of Truth](./docs/PPOT.md)**

Contribution practices, entry types, approval rules, natural-language examples,
and the pull/push handshake used by every skill.

## The Figma board

**→ [Afovea's Product Delivery Team Skills — Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1668354152302142589/afoveas-product-delivery-team-skills)**

A FigJam board that turns this repo into something a team can run in a room. The skills supply the judgement; the board supplies the order, the timings and the checkpoints. Duplicate it into your drafts and work down it.

**An introduction page** covers how the board and the repo fit together, the 28 skills and how to invoke each one, the Project Point of Truth practice, and the product cycle as a **triple diamond** — Discover → Define → Develop → Decide → Build → Deliver and learn, closed by three gates: **Problem agreed**, **Approach agreed**, **Outcome evidenced**. A detail panel per phase names each capability that earns its keep there, when to reach for it, which roles are involved, what comes out, and what it writes to the PPoT.

**Six further pages, one per phase,** hold the working boards. Each capability gets a run-sheet built as numbered zones with a time budget and a stated output, so a session has a shape rather than a blank canvas. Gates get run-sheets of their own, ending in a signed decision that can send the work back a diamond as readily as forward.

It is the visual counterpart of [`docs/capability-map.md`](./docs/capability-map.md) — the same model, laid out to be filled in rather than read. Neither one installs anything: the skills still come from a route in [Install options](#install-options).

[↑ Back to contents](#contents)

## Install options

Five routes, one per product surface. **[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) walks each
one through to a verified install**, with a troubleshooting section keyed to the
exact error text. The summary:

| Route | Command | You get |
|---|---|---|
| **Plugin** *(recommended)* | `/plugin install product-team` | All 29 skills **plus** the gate hook. Updatable with one command. No routing brain |
| **Desktop app** | **+** → Plugins → Add plugin | The same, without a terminal |
| **Cloud / web** | two keys in the repo's `.claude/settings.json` | The same, for everyone opening a cloud session on that repo |
| **Routing only** | `install.sh --routing-only /path/to/project` | The routing brain alone, for when the plugin already supplies the skills |
| **Per project** | `install.sh /path/to/project` | Skills in `<project>/.claude/skills/` **plus** the routing brain in its `CLAUDE.md`. Add `--agents` for `.agents/skills/` and `AGENTS.md` |
| **Personal** | `install.sh --personal` | Skills in `~/.claude/skills/` — every project. Skills only |
| **Submodule** | `install.sh --submodule /path/to/project` | Per-project, pinned to a tag, symlinked so discovery still works |
| **Claude apps** *(no terminal)* | download a ZIP from [`download/`](./download), upload it | The roles you upload, in claude.ai and the Chat tab. No routing brain, no hook |
| **Codex / open standard** | add `--agents` to any `install.sh` route | The same, written to `.agents/skills/` and `AGENTS.md`, invoked as `$name` |

The script is in the repo, so clone first for those routes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/afovea/product-team-skills.git
cd product-team-skills
./install.sh --verify                     # what is installed right now?
./install.sh /path/to/your-project
```

It copies the skills, appends the routing brain to `CLAUDE.md` — or `AGENTS.md` with `--agents` — **with the paths and invocations already rewritten for that host**, updates `.gitignore`, and seeds a pipeline adapter template. Re-running updates the routing block in place between its markers and leaves anything you wrote above it alone. Running it with no arguments prints the menu rather than guessing a target.

### Which route

- **Just want the skills?** Plugin — terminal, desktop app, or a committed `.claude/settings.json` for cloud sessions.
- **Want role arbitration too?** Plugin *plus* `install.sh --routing-only` (add `--agents` on Codex). Routing lives in `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`, which is per-project, so no plugin can carry it. Use `--routing-only` rather than a full per-project install: the latter puts a second copy of all 29 skills on disk, which claims the bare `/name` and then goes stale independently of the plugin.
- **Want it pinned and tracked in the consuming repo?** Submodule.
- **On claude.ai or the desktop app's Chat tab?** Those are a different product from Claude Code — download a ZIP from [`download/`](./download) and upload it, per [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md#part-4--claude-for-chatting-browser-or-chat-tab).

**The repo is the source, not an installation.** Cloning it makes the skills visible nowhere. Claude Code discovers them at `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `<project>/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, or from an installed plugin. Pick a route above, or you will not see them.

### Precedence and duplicates

Enterprise overrides personal, and personal overrides project. Plugin skills are namespaced `plugin-name:skill-name`, so they never *collide* — but the bare name resolves to the filesystem copy. Install both ways and `/product-manager` runs the filesystem skill while the plugin copy stays reachable as `/product-team:product-manager`. Both work; you are just editing one and running the other.

`./install.sh --verify` reports every copy it can find, and says which combinations are worth reducing to one.

### Context cost, and how to turn it down

Installing 29 skills is not free. Two different costs, and the second is the one that actually bites.

**Always-on** — every skill's `name` and `description` are preloaded into the system prompt so the host knows what exists. That is **~2,300 tokens on every session**, including projects with nothing to do with product work. Nothing else loads until a skill is invoked.

**On-invoke** — the skill's body enters the conversation when you call it, and **stays there for the rest of the session**. That ranges from ~1k to ~9.5k tokens depending on the skill. This is the larger number by far.

See your own figures, per skill:

```bash
claude plugin details product-team
```

The heaviest bodies are worth knowing before you invoke them casually:

| Skill | always-on | on-invoke |
|---|---:|---:|
| `motion-designer` | ~270 | ~13k |
| `run-pipeline` | ~110 | ~7.9k |
| `security-specialist` | ~120 | ~7.7k |
| `storm-researcher` | ~90 | ~6.7k |
| *typical role* | ~50–150 | ~1.6–3.6k |

#### Turn the always-on cost off entirely

```bash
claude plugin disable product-team          # off, still installed
claude plugin enable product-team           # back on
claude plugin disable --all                 # every plugin
```

`disable` takes `--scope user|project|local`, so you can switch the suite off globally and leave it on in one repo, or the reverse.

#### Scope it to the projects that need it

Installing at project scope keeps the always-on cost out of every unrelated session:

```bash
claude plugin install product-team@productteam-skills --scope project
```

#### Drop skills you never use

There is no per-skill disable. Two ways to trim anyway:

- **Filesystem install** — delete the directories you do not want. `install.sh --personal` then `rm -r ~/.claude/skills/motion-designer` removes that skill and its always-on share. Losing `motion-designer` alone saves ~210 tokens per session, more than four typical roles.
- **Fork the plugin** — remove the skill directories from `skills/` and point your marketplace at your fork. Survives updates; a filesystem deletion does not.

#### Managing the on-invoke cost

- A skill loads **once** per session. Re-invoking the same one adds a short note, not a second copy.
- Start a fresh session to clear loaded skills, rather than invoking a different one to "switch".
- After auto-compaction, invoked skills are re-attached at up to 5,000 tokens each within a **combined 25,000-token budget**, most-recent first. Invoke many heavy skills in one session and the earliest ones get dropped entirely — so if a skill seems to stop influencing behaviour after a long session, re-invoke it.

### Migrating from the old repo

This suite previously lived at `afovea/ProductTeam-skills`, which is now archived. If you installed from there:

```bash
# 1. point the marketplace at the new repo
claude plugin marketplace remove productteam-skills
claude plugin marketplace add afovea/product-team-skills
claude plugin install product-team

# 2. if you used a filesystem install from an older layout, clear the stale
#    nested pipeline directory — skills are flat now
rm -r ~/.claude/skills/pipeline            # personal installs
rm -r <project>/.claude/skills/pipeline    # project installs
```

Earlier versions nested the eight pipeline skills one level deeper, so an old install leaves that directory behind and they end up present twice. `install.sh` detects this and prints the exact command rather than deleting anything itself.

### Compatibility

The skills are plain markdown following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard, so they work with any host that reads `SKILL.md`. Two hosts are supported with a route of their own rather than left to you to wire up: Claude Code, and Codex.

The suite is written twice over where the two disagree, so neither is a second-class citizen:

| | Claude Code | Codex |
|---|---|---|
| Skills | `.claude/skills/` | `.agents/skills/` |
| Invocation | `/name` | `$name` |
| Suppress auto-selection | `disable-model-invocation` | `agents/openai.yaml` |
| Routing brain | `CLAUDE.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| Plugin manifest | `.claude-plugin/` | `.codex-plugin/` |
| Gate enforcement | `Stop` hook | `Stop` hook |

`install.sh` writes either — add `--agents` for the second column — and `./install.sh --verify` reports both.

What survives on each surface:

| | Skills | Routing brain | Gate hook |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code — terminal, desktop **Code** tab, cloud | ✅ | ✅ with a project install | ✅ |
| Codex — CLI and IDE | ✅ | ✅ with a project install | ✅ |
| Claude apps — claude.ai, desktop **Chat** tab, Cowork | ✅ ones you upload | ❌ no `CLAUDE.md` | ❌ no hooks |
| Any other `SKILL.md` host | ✅ via `--agents` | depends on the host | depends on the host |

Gate enforcement needs a host with hooks. Claude Code and Codex both have a `Stop` event that a hook can refuse, and the same script serves both. Where hooks do not exist, the pipeline skills still run and still report a failing gate — they just cannot be stopped by one.

**Observed on Codex**, not inferred from the spec: installed to `~/.agents/skills/`, the roles appear in the `$` picker carrying the display names and descriptions from their `agents/openai.yaml`, and a fresh session handed a design problem in prose answers it directly rather than summoning a role — so `allow_implicit_invocation: false` does what it claims. The extra frontmatter fields these skills carry beyond `name` and `description` are ignored rather than rejected. The `Stop` hook is the one part shared by both hosts that has so far only been exercised on Claude Code.

Claude Code in **WSL** is the one Claude Code surface without plugins — use a filesystem install there.

[↑ Back to contents](#contents)

## The routing brain (optional second layer)

[`routing.md`](./routing.md) goes in a project's `CLAUDE.md` — or its `AGENTS.md` for Codex — and decides which role or squad a request belongs to, so you can ask in prose instead of picking a skill:

> "The error message when a payment fails is confusing. Rewrite it." → Content Designer
> "This chart distinguishes four series by colour alone." → Accessibility Specialist
> "Fix the typo in the footer." → no specialist; it is a mechanical edit

It also defines **six squads** for cross-functional work — Discovery, Definition, Delivery, Validation, Growth, Platform — because "is this ready to ship?" is not one discipline's call.

Squads are not the six *phases* of the product cycle, despite three of the names colliding. A squad is who you need; a phase is where you are. [`docs/capability-map.md`](./docs/capability-map.md) maps one onto the other.

Measured at **89.6% selection accuracy** across 16 cases (up from 70.8%). Two findings drove the improvement, both worth knowing if you edit it:

- **Keyword collision beats persona overlap.** A single salient word drags a request to the wrong role. Where roles genuinely overlap, routing coped fine.
- **The roles table outweighs the prose rules below it.** One case failed 0/3 across three prose edits, then passed when two words changed in the table. Put load-bearing distinctions in the table.

## Delivery pipeline

`/run-pipeline` is the entry point. It classifies scope, surfaces a plan for confirmation, then dispatches — Small runs a single scoped change, Medium adds requirements/shaping and a chunk loop, Large adds repository inspection and an architect plan.

Two documents make it portable:

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`reference/project-adapter.md`](./reference/project-adapter.md) | Your project's package manager, gate chain, generated artefacts, risky paths, host integrations. Copy to `.claude/pipeline-adapter.md` and fill in |
| [`reference/state-schema.md`](./reference/state-schema.md) | The shared state contract, and how skills degrade when state is unavailable |

**It runs without an adapter.** Skills fall back to discovering commands from repository instructions, manifests, CI config and the lockfile, and state what they found. Writing the adapter makes it deterministic and lets you declare what discovery cannot infer — which gates may fail, which paths are risky, whether an independent reviewer exists.

Nothing assumes a JavaScript toolchain, a specific agent host, or a writable cache.

### Verified by running, not reading

| Testbed | Result |
|---|---|
| npm project **with** an adapter — blocking drift gate, ratcheted style gate at accepted baseline 3, deliberately stale artefact | `run-pipeline`, `execute-chunk`, `close-chunk`, `cleanup-verify` all correct |
| Python/Make project with **no adapter** and no cache | Discovery fallback correct, zero JavaScript assumptions |

Specifically observed: a "one-line" schema change correctly promoted Small → Medium; `execute-chunk` skipping the build and drift gates because the chunk did not touch a declared risk path; `close-chunk` re-running the gate chain itself rather than trusting the implementer's report; `cleanup-verify` regenerating a stale artefact, refusing to commit it, withholding the gate stamp and returning `BLOCKED`.

### Enforcing the gates

Everything above describes what the pipeline *should* do. A skill that says "run the gate chain" is an instruction, and an instruction can be skipped. `cleanup-verify` returning `BLOCKED` is a report, not a stop.

The plugin ships a `Stop` hook that makes it a stop. Hooks are the only layer in Claude Code that runs as code rather than as instruction, so the gate chain becomes non-negotiable rather than well-intentioned.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `scripts/gate-chain.py` | Resolves and runs the gate chain, reports a JSON result, writes a stamp |
| `hooks/gate-stop.py` | The `Stop` hook: refuses to end the turn while a blocking gate is failing |
| `hooks/hooks.json` | Registers the hook. Loads automatically when the plugin is enabled |

**It only wakes up for an open run.** A `Stop` hook fires every turn, so the hook first looks for a pipeline state file under `.claude/`. No state file, no gates, no cost. Detection is by shape rather than by exact filename, so renaming the state contract does not break it. A run can opt out entirely with `"gate_required": false` in its state.

**A pass is bound to the tree it ran against.** The stamp records a fingerprint of `HEAD`, the full uncommitted diff, and the contents of every untracked file git is not ignoring. That last part matters: new source files are untracked until they are committed, and without hashing them a green result would go on vouching for a file it had only ever seen in its first version. Any subsequent edit invalidates the stamp.

**It will not trap you.** After three consecutive blocks on the same tree the hook releases the turn with a warning rather than looping.

`gate-chain.py` is standalone and dependency-free, so pipeline skills can invoke it directly instead of describing the chain in prose:

```bash
python3 scripts/gate-chain.py run --stamp     # run the chain, stamp on pass
python3 scripts/gate-chain.py status          # is there a valid stamp?
python3 scripts/gate-chain.py gates           # show the resolved chain
```

Gate resolution follows the same declare-then-discover pattern as the rest of the pipeline, first hit wins:

1. `.claude/pipeline-gates.json`
2. a ` ```gates ` fenced block in `.claude/pipeline-adapter.md`
3. discovery from `package.json`, `Makefile` or `pyproject.toml`

The adapter form is one gate per line, `name: command`, with a leading `?` marking a gate non-blocking:

```gates
lint: npm run lint
typecheck: npm run typecheck
test: npm test
?style: npm run style
```

Scratch files live in `.claude/.gate/`, which excludes itself from version control. Nothing needs adding to a consuming project's `.gitignore`.

`reference/` holds documents that five pipeline skills share. They are not skills, so they sit outside `skills/` rather than being forced into a directory that pretends otherwise.

## Conventions

- All skills use **UK English**.
- Every skill carries the standard `name` and `description`. Role and pipeline skills additionally use the repository's Claude-specific invocation and metadata fields. The PPoT practice keeps portable minimal frontmatter.
- Every skill also carries an `agents/openai.yaml` with its display name and short description for Codex. The 28 that set `disable-model-invocation: true` add `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` there, which is the same instruction in Codex's dialect; `ppot` deliberately omits it. `scripts/verify.sh` fails if the two ever disagree, so adding a skill means adding both.
- Keep skill bodies **under 500 lines**, per [Anthropic's authoring guidance](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices). Past that, move detail into that skill's `references/` and link to it with a stated trigger for when to read it.
- Every skill ends with `## Maintenance` listing its review triggers. Treat that as a versioning prompt: bump role and pipeline skill metadata when their behaviour changes, and bump the plugin version when the shared PPoT practice changes.

## Versioning

Semver, tagged `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` on `main`.

- **MAJOR** — breaking change to a skill's contract or to installed paths.
- **MINOR** — new skill, new intent, new output type.
- **PATCH** — wording, clarifications, frontmatter fixes.

Consuming projects should pin to a tag and update deliberately.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests welcome.

- Follow the existing skill structure when adding one.
- Update [routing.md](./routing.md): a row in the relevant table, squad memberships if cross-functional, and an entry in the specialist-routing examples. **The table matters more than the prose** — see the routing findings above.
- Bump the skill's frontmatter `version` on behaviour-shaping changes.
- Tag a release after merge to `main`.
